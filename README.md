## Specifications
- Can detect signals from 500kHz to 1.76GHz
- Ethernet Connectivity
- Input Voltage: 5v - 25.2v
- Effective Range: 1000ft -> Search Diameter 2000ft

## Hardware Requirements

For all current modes of operation, it is required that the Kraken be connected to the same tcp/ip network as the groundstation device. For our testing, we used Trellisware Ethernet radios, with the [Ghost 850](https://www.trellisware.com/trellisware-radios/tw-ghost-870/) mounted to the UAV

## Modes of operation:

#### Standalone  


#### UAV integration
